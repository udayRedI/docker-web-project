# Steps to setup project

Step1: Go to https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ and install docker for ubuntu.

Step2: We now need to build the sub-projects.
Run `docker build -t pr-<folder-name> .` in all folders.

Step3: Now we need to create a tag for the images.
Run `docker tag pr-<folder-name> uday0docker/pr-<folder-name>:init` in all folders.

Step4: Be sure to shutdown local apache/ngnix servers leaving `80` port alone.

Step5: Run `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml` in root directory.

To make sure its running properly run `docker service ls` and find the services online with running containers.
